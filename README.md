# Classical Study Music
> An Amazon Alexa application that plays classical background music on command.

![Amazon Echo Device](http://cdn.slashgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/amazon-echo.jpg)

This skill gives Alexa the ability to instantly play classical backgroundâ€” allowing you to focus on studying, concentrate on your current project, or simply hone-in on the task at hand. For many, light classical music can help with concentration and meditation.


### Featuring:
_Johann Sebastian Bach - Goldberg Variations, BWV 988_<br>
Courtesy of the [OpenGoldbergVariations.org](http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/) project, and performed by the talented Kimiko Ishizaka.
